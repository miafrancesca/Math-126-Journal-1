<p>This was suprisingly quick code to write. 
Challenges arose from finding efficient ways to execute calculations, and to create a product that could actually be useful to a user.
I knew I would need a Vector class, and a client class to handle input/output to the user, but midway through I realized that
creating a Point class was also useful. </p>
